This repository houses the codes associated with the experiments for my masters thesis titled "A study on the impact of feature selection on data analysis".

Implementations in [scikit-feature](https://jundongl.github.io/scikit-feature/index.html) were used. In other to run the codes, prerequisite libraries in **requirements.txt** file must be installed. 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
