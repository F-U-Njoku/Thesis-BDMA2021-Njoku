This repository houses the codes associated with the experiments for my masters thesis titled "A study on the impact of feature selection on data analysis".

Implementations in [scikit-feature](https://jundongl.github.io/scikit-feature/index.html) were used in this work. In other to run the codes, prerequisite libraries in **requirements.txt** file must be installed. Before doing so I recommend setting up a [Virtual Environment (VE)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for this experiment after which you install the required libraries in the VE with the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After navigating to the path where the experiment scripts are stored (do make sure youe VE is activated), a script is executed with the following command:
```
python script-name.py >> outputfile-name.csv
```
This returns the output in a csv file ready to be used for analysis.
